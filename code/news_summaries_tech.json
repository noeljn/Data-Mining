to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot.The ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb.If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station.The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated.The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as Serbia, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey."}, {"id": "002", "text": "Laws on net cafe opening

first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first \"successful\" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac).The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket

made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980.I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list.The oldest \"gadget\" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place.The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first \"lightweight\" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs.The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever.By far the most useful gadget.\"In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,\" it concluded.The magazine specified that gadgets

carried out the poll.The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time.Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that.Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people.\"By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are,\" according to Mr Ash.Trust in online security is falling as a result.It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode.In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems.One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity.The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online.Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget.For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.\"The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,\" he said.It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions.Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said.The code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key.He added: \"The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.\"It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,\" said Mr Ash.\"You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given."}, {"id": "032", "text": "The system is not available commercially yet, but

July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones.But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod.Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone, the W800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera.This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said Gartner.It was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner.But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too, according to Gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology.Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own.Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives.More likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services."}, {"id": "065", "text": "Jerry Yang, who remains the firm's \"Chief Yahoo\", is proud of what the company has achieved.Yahoo, one of the net's most iconic companies, is celebrating

developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget.The biggest culprit, according to the EPA, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed \"energy vampires\".At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment.\"We are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply,\" the

high-definition films demand.What high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur.Currently, an entire DVD project can take up to three months, says Mr Dean.But when high-definition films do come out on the new format DVDs, it will profoundly change home entertainment.Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition DVD.First it was the humble home video, then it was the DVD, and now Hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.And if studios do focus on delivering more \"added value content\", thinks Mr Dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it.High-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike.It will take time though to persuade people who spent money on DVD players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition DVDs in 18 months' time.High-definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than the DVDs we are used to.Mr Dean is confident though: \"I think if they see real HD [high-definition], not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference.High-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too.On the whole, producing films for high-definition DVDs will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed.Equally, it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD.\"In the HD version of Episode I, all these make-up lines showed up,\" explains Mr

short time.The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range.The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too.Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile.The BBC News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing.A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology.What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push.But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too.That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can.By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset.Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics.Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in.The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too.The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit.There are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets.The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost

this occasion a youth named CJ, who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive 3D environment.San Andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.The 18 certificate GTA: San Andreas for the PlayStation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach.CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane.At a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, San Andreas' violence, or specifically

a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.Ultimately, there will be, says Mr Donofrio, no value in being \"computer illiterate\".But, says Nick Donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at IBM, it was not \"the thing\" itself that actually improved people's lives.Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and \"deep computing\", says Mr Donofrio.IBM, according to Mr Donofrio, has 30%.To Mr Donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen.\"I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,\" says Mr Donofrio.But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be \"in your face\".When history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially.But pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world.The whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to Mr Donofrio.\"When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st Century, we have to think more like this, but faster,\" Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website, after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering 2004 Hinton Lecture.\"I am confident that the SET [science,

part of a movie.The impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped.Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.After almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.Could Half-Life 2 possibly live up to the hype?It has the look of a beautiful Eastern European city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well

moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse.\"The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,\" he said.This, said Sloncek, should make the

trouble.Armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name.Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files.The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data.And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name.After all, I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems.And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more

same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused?Any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it.The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions

India, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal.This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD.The answer, says Prof Brewer, is wi-fi.And now, an Indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap

phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles.For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form.\"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab.Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists.One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said.\"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\"People's habits remain the same,\" said Dr

not the only issues that should be considered,\" said Dr Avineri.\"As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see 'who' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the 'personal transport' marketplace.\"\"It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need.Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport.The company's vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in

Kalanick, founder and chairman of P2P network Red Swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology.The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.Since the first successful file-sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them.\"We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,\" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer.But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks.\"Increasingly, what you are seeing on P2P is consumer-created content,\" said Derek Broes, from Microsoft.P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January.But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.Looking into P2P's future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned.But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.\"They will probably pay an increasing role in helping P2P spread,\" he said.Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms,

shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse.\"The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,\" he said.This, said Sloncek, should make

broadcasts.According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales, 30% of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV.Broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes.BT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband.Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value, says the BBC, because it gives people more control, and more choice.It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders (PVRs), gives people much more control over TV.It helps, said Mr Burke, that people are more au fait with terms like \"digital\", \"interactive\", now that digital TV reaches more than 56% of UK homes.But IPTV could be used for home-monitoring, \"pet cams\", localised news services, and local authority TV, too says BT.Analysts say that IPTV will account for 10% of the digital TV market in Europe alone

such a task.\"Given it [the net] was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions.With broadband take-up growing, services like voice and TV will open up interesting challenges for the net.The net's growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the IETF.As the new chair of the

abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers.He said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music, conceptually the technology had \"some really excellent

range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera.Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design

is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying.The problem they face, said Shailendra Jain, head

number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them, said Mr Jain.Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003.Until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to.\"The rate we

want a slice of it.Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology.The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.Since the first successful file-sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them.\"We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,\" said Marc

music and any other digital content.The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January.But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.Looking into P2P's future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned.But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.\"They will probably play an increasing role in helping P2P spread,\" he

upcoming PSP handheld console.Mr Wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game.The Game Developers Conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games.Mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games.EA Mobile is a division of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher.According to Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios, next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title.But numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop.Even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.Making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money, an industry conference has been told.Such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game

do not have any patents to trade.More directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent.They have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.A new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson.The same does not hold for a patent.After all, how much fuss can you generate about the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, and the way it amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention?If the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products.It is a small invention, but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.Much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the Apache web server, the GNU/Linux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements.The new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s.If it gets its way, the Dutch government will conclude its presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the European Parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of European citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them.The new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas.It will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas.The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents.Many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement.If it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then I could defend myself in court by claiming that I had simply made it up and it was coincidence.A patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other

four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...  As many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively.This game dominated 2 years of my life.24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days !\"The sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his Warcraft game.Online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality.Some of the comments were humorous: \"This game is so good I'm not going to get it, there's no way I could limit the hours I'd spend playing it,\" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England.I play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but I don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.When you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.However, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent.The people who tend to hark on about about the problems of \"hardcore gaming\" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game.But some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): \"'You need to get out more' could be the motto of any MMORPG.It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are \"easier\" and more fun than the real world.It's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life...\"An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,\" wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas.Whilst I would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, I believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching TV.Great game!Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something I'm increasingly concerned with...  Me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to 'frag' some individual.I am obsessed with online role playing games.Massively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds.Obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing EverQuest has a problem.Sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, I find myself longing to have the time to join them.Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: \"I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot.I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex.The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session.I know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing Warcraft.It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one.Online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others.In a game where you will never complete an \"ultimate\" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit.A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...  Championship Manager consumed my life for years.When I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I'm trying not to spend so much time on there.I have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer.Seven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online.When video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning.I gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the European version (couldn't help myself).An 11 hour stretch isn't that surprising - I've known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch.I wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn't.Gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.Online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far.The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite.When I was single I used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres.Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.\"You lie; you don't go into work because you \"had stuff to do at home\"; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching TV (a good thing, presumably),\" he wrote, explaining how EverQuest took over his time.Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.Another correspondent wrote: \"I believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.\"From morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink.Despite having little monetary value, the \"rewards\" and encouragement offered by these MMORPGs is enough to hook games for hours daily.The problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.Unfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make.\"I am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in MMOPRGs than in reality,\" she said.Scare-mongering articles about \"addictive video games\" have existed since the days the first game of Pong stopped everyone from working at the Atari offices.When I was made redundant I told my partner I had a new job for three months whilst every day I played EverQuest from 7:30am till 5:pm.And more and more so I find I have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.They are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level."}]
