Comments:  In the conclusions the authors say that \"We have identified two classes of flawed spectra which were not picked up by the automatic classification because of their very small number of training samples. Per construction machine learning techniques can not classify such outliers.\" This sentence should be further explained. As Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman say in The Elements of Statistical Learning (see Chapter 7): \"it is too difficult to give a general rule on how much training data is enough; among other things, this depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying function, and the complexity of the models being fit to the data. \" So, by just saying that the number of training samples is small you do not provide enough information to decide whether machine learning techniques are adequate or not to solve a problem.

While the paper is a statistical study, it would have benefited with a context of an actual example.

General comments:  a) Concerning the proposed approach: The segmentation method introduced only considers local color/gray value information. Perhaps introducing other features related to the membrane's local (e.g. the membrane has symmetry properties that can be exploited) or global (e.g. continuity, approximately circular shape) properties may improve the segmentation results.  Feature selection is also a key component to improve performance. Use a feature selection procedure.  b) Concerning the experimentation: You should describe the experiments with sufficient detail so others can replicate them: a) Make your data publicly available b) Explain how you have selected the classifier's parameters (parameter selection in an SVM is critical and may improve notably the performance).  You should join Figs 10 and 9 in a single plot so we can better see the differences.  You only provide qualitative segmentation results (Figs. 12, 14, 15), but quantitative results are also very important. Specially when it comes to comparisons. You should quantitatively compare your algorithm with other competing works in the literature.  c) Concerning paper organization: The paper is well written and clearly introduces the problem, describes the relevant literature and presents the solution. I have a few comments concerning the paper organization: a) Problem statement and literature review (intro and theoretical framework sections) are in my opinion a bit long, compared to other important sections, e.g. feature extraction and experimentation which are just one paragraph each. b) Although English is in general correct, there are some small mistakes that could be solved by having it read by a professional. c) There are two \"proposed method\" sections  Well written paper.

Moreover, the paper concludes that the proposed approach is not good enough.  - The features used for classification lacks of frequency information around each pixel (although it used the first derivative with sobel).

It depends on two another papers for its complete understanding. The math is very well stated but I was unable to see the advantages or purpose of that math regarding gait control. Also, it is not clear for the reader how fast or slow is the calculation time regarding task time.",
