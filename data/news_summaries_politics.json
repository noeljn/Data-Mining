Michael Howard has said his party would cut \u00c2\u00a335bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow \u00c2\u00a34bn in tax cuts.Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some \u00c2\u00a350bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny.Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans.On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour.The prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure.In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education.Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\".\"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the

old Tory-Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see \"modest\" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services.The Tories claim they can improve services AND cut taxes through \u00c2\u00a335bn efficiency savings, while Labour has offered \u00c2\u00a322bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases.With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack.Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be \"significant players\" in the poll.Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an \"honest choice\" at the next general election.Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not \"foment an

fare at the general election.Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the Tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.He is prepared to go this far: \"A clear conclusion has been reached, including by Conservatives, that the Conservatives are not going to win this election.\"I think the tax argument has moved on a lot in British politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election,\" he said.If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament \"on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us\".That last remark reflects a view gaining ground in Westminster that, if the Tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party.\"We are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies\".\"Therefore the potential is there for the Liberal Democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election, given that we have the capacity to take on Labour and win as well as take

teachings of Islam.Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed.The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government.Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/  I agree with Mr Forsyth.The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests.I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth.Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'I do not usually agree with Mr. Forsyth, but he is spot on here.An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.The threat now is new.I agree with Frederick Forsyth.As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.If the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair.I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat.I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth.Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people.Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.In this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak out.Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK.I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as Mr. Forsythe's opening comments suggest.The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government.This government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny.2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it.The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of.I agree with Mr Forsyth's views.I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.The nature of the current threat is new.But in the 66 years that I have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us.Yes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth's views.But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently.Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked.Forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001.But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-Qaeda tyranny.I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him.These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same.Forsyth is wrong.If the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next?That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort.The government is seeking to introduce a police state.That goes right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they \"knew best\".Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides.Like New Labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests.Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence.Frederick Forsyth puts it beautifully.Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler.Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs.The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy.I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one.But history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power.The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism.I don't usually have much time for Mr Forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.At this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public.The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses.The idea that the \"new terrorism\" demands new powers is erroneous.You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.It is based and funded abroad; so was the IRA.This puts it on a par with the government of Burma.Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.The terrorists have already won.Like New Labour, he called himself a libertarian.(apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?).Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?And without becoming a tyranny.When you look at today's Britain, you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.But as Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.It has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the IRA.Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.You cannot compare the threats of past years with now.Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing.I agree.If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any.Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties."}, {"id": "291", "text": "Both unions are remaining

sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name?\"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said.Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue.Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to \"change the face of British politics\" as he launched his new party.Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done.Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.The electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP.Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in \"lies and spin\", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend.Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.Brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!It's all flash and no real policy here  Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP.Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down.Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer.Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities.UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.Whatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England.Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat.Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk.UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.I wouldn't write off Kilroy-Silk.The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating.Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me.Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not.Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue.He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader.If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then

was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he

reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes

wage.The minimum wage will rise in October, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.I don't believe in the minimum wage at all!This is great news, but that might be because I work for minimum wage.Hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.The other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  It is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the \"lower status\" jobs.I think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them.The Trade Unions Congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a \u00c2\u00a36 minimum wage by next year.The government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.If the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the \u00c2\u00a36.00 mark there

continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.Still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.I might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.We all remember Michael Howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one!In answer to Emma from

raising the case of Margaret Dixon, whose operation had been cancelled seven times, which grabbed headlines for the party two weeks ago."}, {"id": "409", "text": "Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair's record in government.Conservative leader Michael Howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech.He also attacked the government's \"failure\" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS, telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime.Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year.Tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election, declaring Britain needs \"a change at the top\"."}, {"id": "410", "text": "Mr

only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election.Mr Sayeed had denied the claims, saying the suspension was \"unjust and wrong\" but he made an \"unreserved\" apology to MPs in the Commons chamber.Mr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen \"well below the standards expected\".The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed."}, {"id": "411", "text": "Mr Howard claimed, with some justification, that the Tories' campaign has got off to a \"great start\".But as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper, the party at least has reason to hope that, like his Australian namesake, Mr Howard really isn't finished yet.But Mr Howard's overall message - that the Tories have Labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago.They have had Labour on the back foot over immigration, with Tony Blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card, and have even managed to score points in traditional Labour territory such as health and education.Some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970, when Ted Heath, behind in the polls and written off by the pundits, snatched victory from Harold Wilson's Labour Party.Michael Howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech, at his party's spring conference in Brighton, to deliver a smart rebuff to Peter Hain's description of him as an \"attack mongrel\", claiming such personal abuse meant Labour was \"rattled\" by the Tory challenge.And here he was again, moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause, to make a personal, ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory.The audience's reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards.Mr Howard was also joined on stage by his wife Sandra, daughter Larissa and stepson Sholto.Much of the credit for the Tories' recent change of fortune must go to Lynton Crosby, the Australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper John Howard, of Australia's Liberal Party, into a serial election winner.\"It was very disappointing.\"I always know where I am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me,\" he said.They all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001.The Peter Hain \"mongrel\" attack, he says, is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product, he claims, of the Tories setting the agenda.Even allowing for the natural bias against the Tories in some opinion polls, they are still behind, when to have a chance of overturning Labour's whopping majority, they should really be ahead.Oliver Letwin, one of the men lampooned in the Labour poster, affects bewilderment at what he believes is Labour's loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail."}, {"id": "412", "text": "There will

was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues.Mr Blair said the government was also looking at \"how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others\", as part of a review being carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department.Asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to Labour, he said: \"It's important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute.\"He told The Observer government life was a \"constant barrage of attack\" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute.Mr Blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public, during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks.Mr Blair also spoke of meeting many people

Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907.The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies.The

would get another chance to vote against the plans.Speaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: \"People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be.\"\"We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,\" he said.Unveiling the slogan at the party's spring conference, he said there was no \"glass ceiling\"
